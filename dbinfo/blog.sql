(278, 67, 'Interview process', 'Hello everyone, today we have Shashank Sinha who has been placed at BCG. So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly what was the general interview process for the companies you interview also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'So I interviewed for the Boston Consulting Group and I’ll be talking about the recruiting process of BCG only. The process usually starts with the initial CV shortlisting round so there will be around 27 folks getting shortlisted based on their CV and once you are shortlisted then in 10 days, you’ll have case rounds with associates and seniors associated with the firm. So there are usually 2–3 rounds based on how you perform in those rounds and once this is completed you will have a span of 3 days in which you will have final interviews which will be with the principal and partners of the firm. In the principal rounds, the number of interviews will vary from 1 to 3 and again for partner rounds it will vary but most will be 2. The process roughly remains the same across years but the timeline usually varies.'),
(279, 67, 'Questions asked', 'Thanks Shashank for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'So in each of the rounds that I have mentioned there will be on an average 6–7 interviews by combining all the rounds and each of them will have 2 sections, first will be your experience section which is your CV discussion part and then there will a case round, roughly there will span of around 30 minutes for which interviews will last. 2–3 minutes for the initial round of personal experience then around 20 mins for case solving and 2–3 minutes for your questions for the interviewer, this will be the general structure for each of the rounds you will go through. So regarding questions, in terms of case studies, the cases generally can be broken into four parts which are guesstimates, profitability, market entry and unconventional. So in the initial rounds, you’ll have mixtures of the first three parts i.e guesstimates, profitability and market entry cases, these cases can be in isolation or a mixture and in the final round you will have mostly unconventional cases. So I’ll brief in my case, in my first two rounds I had a mixture of guesstimates and market entry and when I advanced to principal rounds, first I had a mixture of guesstimates and profitability and after that, I only had unconventional cases. For instance, in one of the principal rounds, I had a question like suppose there is a steel manufacturing company and I had to suggest recommendations to lower its cost.\r\n'),
(280, 67, 'FAQs for HR round', 'That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'So in terms of HR questions, BCG doesn’t, in particular, has any HR round. In all the 6 rounds, they will ask questions based on your personal experience, they’ll check your personality so firstly you have to introduce yourself and then they’ll pick one of the relevant questions like regarding your recent internship or any other interesting section they find and then they will grill you on that. And once you advance through the partner rounds then the so-called fit / Hr questions come in. As in my case, was, I had a similar kind of role in my internship So they asked, “Why management consultancy and why BCG in particular ”, “Where do you see yourself in the next 4–5 years and what are your future goals and how you see those goals aligned with you spending your time at BCG” and then there will surely a question when you are interviewing for the consulting firm “Whether you want to do MBA or not”. These are some of the questions which they typically ask but with BCG your case solving skills is one that carries more weight.'),
(281, 67, 'Advice for placements 2022', 'That’s rightly said, so the next question is What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'So in any of the consulting firms you sit for, the process starts with CV screening and what they look for is “Spikes in your CV”, a term you commonly come across when applying for the consult. So you need to have at least a couple of spikes in your CV to get shortlisted and what I mean by spikes is like being in the top 3–4 candidates who have applied for the firm in that particular genre or in each of the parts that you have in your CV which are Academics, Intern, Position of responsibilities to name a few. So elaborating further, when we talk about academics, having CG above 9 is considered to be a spike, or your department rank 1 or 2. Coming to internships, having a Day 1 internship will be counted as a spike but not only that even if you secured an off-campus internship but at a very reputable firm i.e top in their respective sector then coming to projects if you have FT over there, then surely that will be counted as spike and coming to extracurricular activities if you have Inter-IIT medals that will help or any regional or national awards and when it comes to the position of responsibilities then VP, Placecomms, Gymkhana Gsecs, Senate positions and senior positions in the clubs and cells will be counted as spikes. These are just rough approximations and may vary from firm to firm on how they define it. Moving on to how you need to prepare, first you need to make case groups and the best time for this is in Summers while you will be interning so that you are not left out. Its usually recommended that your case group size is around 3–4. For case prep, there are no resources available, but to start you can watch “Case interviews cracked” workshops by IIT Bombay available on Youtube .so once you have started on then there are 2 case studies books which people usually follow IIT Bombay’s “Case interviews Cracked” which has a good no of questions and then “Day 1.0” from IIT Madras. These are the 3 particular sources which I referred to as I had 12–14 days to prepare so as I had mentioned you should ideally have 3–4 people in your case group and combining cases from both these books you will have roughly 80 cases, so no of cases that you have is very limited and so you don’t need to waste your cases so what I mean from that is, like in your case group there will be different people who’ll be making you do cases and then there will be you who will be making them do the cases. So whichever case you are making them do, basically you are reading through the cases so whenever you read through the case the case gets wasted because the core part of it like you solving the case without initially having a run through the cases is crucial as then your raw thinking comes into play as in the hindsight the case would seem very obvious. Now coming to the number of days you need to prepare so 40 days is usually considered ideal but in our case even 15 days sufficed. Now apart from the case-solving skill that you will find in the resources mentioned, your communication and business intuitions are very critical and those are something which you can start working right now, when you read about businesses and you know how different businesses work, how strategic decision making is done, you find yourself in an advantageous position as cases are business scenario simulations. To work on it you can read books on investing or you can refer to Twitter handles and news sources like the Ken. With around 8–9 months left for a candidate to prepare even if he/she gives 15–20 minutes daily then they can accumulate sufficient flavour of business.\r\n'),
(282, 67, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for Technical rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'So I mentioned earlier, the timeline you’ll have is very short, For BCG in particular we only had 15 days and in general, the CV submission opens by the time you will be wrapping your summer internships, so there will be a lot of chaos and once you receive the shortlist by then only your prep starts. There are 5–6 skills that are typically looked for which are communication, structuring, mathematics which is problem-solving ability then personality, critical thinking then business acumen. So once you have formed case groups and have started solving cases, you will tend to follow frameworks that you will get used to after solving 4–5 cases. It’s really important you revise each case and learn from the mistakes made and don’t repeat them and try to improvise your framework and make it more and more customized which suits your approach to each of the cases you encounter. Once you have solved sufficient cases in your case group you can start reaching out to seniors who sat for placements in previous years and also try to exchange buddy round cases of other shortlisted candidates.'),
(283, 67, 'Message for the Junta', 'So, anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'So something that I have felt in my stay at KGP. Since we have a crowd of around 1500 folks sitting for placements, it’s chaotic as times and people tend to run behind the things just for the sake of glory a particular profile brings with it. So you must take a break and understand where you fit in, try talking to seniors who will help you in the process. Now coming to specifically what you need to work upon is something I have already talked about just to add on that the case groups that you will be forming need to be people who are honest and brutal to you and share the same enthusiasm as you are the average of your case group. Also when you will be shortlisted what happens is that various companies will be releasing their shortlists in a short time so what usually tends to happen is people receive the shortlist in one and not in others so they tend to lose confidence and drop preparation midway so you need to have the right kind of people in your case group who don’t drop the preparation midway. Apart from that since consulting has very limited offers so at times people usually tend to think that it’s not worth investing 1–1.5 months for case interviews preparations but what happens is the very skills you develop from your case preparation helps you ace other interviews be it product, finance or Business analyst. So if you believe you have a knack for it you should surely give it a shot without being concerned about your chances of making it.'),
(284, 67, 'Thank you', 'Thank you Shashank, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements.', 'Thank you!'),

So we are here to interview him regarding his preparations and strategies to crack the interview of this company. So firstly What was the general interview process for the companies you interviewed also Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'I interviewed only for BCG. The interview process consisted of 2 rounds as evaluative buddy rounds followed by 4 rounds of interviews on the final day. The first 2 rounds on the D-Day were strictly case rounds, where one case was Math heavy and another one was around Qualitative judgment. The last 2 rounds had both fit and case, where cases were easier and non-calculative but there was a fair amount of focus on HR Questions and Personality judgment.'),
(286, 66, 'Questions asked', 'Thanks Divyam for explaining the general interview process. Now can you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'Yes, Sure. The questions for the cases were 1. Guesstimate the Number of ATMs in Dubai 2. Indian Public Equities Optimal Portfolio Allocation for a long-haul investment strategy 3. Profitability of a Steel Manufacturer 4. Market Share Expansion Strategy for OLA Electric Scooters. And for HR discussion the questions were 1. Easiest and Hardest Internships and learnings from the same 2. Most Challenging aspect of being in the Placement Committee during a pandemic 3. Steps you would follow to set up a soft skills club at IIT Bombay.'),
(287, 66, 'FAQs for HR round', 'That would be helpful Coming to the next question What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'For FAQs, I think one must prepare for Why they want to enter Management Consulting, Why that specific firm, about their strengths and weaknesses, and briefs of their PoR and Internship experiences.'),

(289, 66, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'Surely, your advice will be really valuable for all of us. so coming to our last question of the day. How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'Yes the resources which one can use are:- 1. Books 1.1 Case Interviews Cracked 1.2 DayOne 1.3 Wharton 2010 Casebook( only some relevant parts) 1.4 Some handful cases/guesstimates from IIMA/L and ISB CaseBooks 2. Videos 2.1 Case Interviews Cracked Webinars 2.2 Aaditya Agarwal mock case videos And I regarding the strategy I would like to say that:- 1. It is critical to focus on learnings from each case rather than solving more cases. I spent at least 30–40 mins with the case after solving it with the case partner, in the analysis, I would spend time on understanding how the case could have been done faster/better and would check the strength of my structure by testing it for root causes other than the one that was the case. 2. I used to keep a note of my strengths/weaknesses of each case and used to read these notes twice daily for all the cases 3. Doing cases with multiple partners, especially alumni helped me to develop as an interviewee, and would recommend students to do cases with at least 4-To 5 different interviewers.'),
(290, 66, 'Thank you!', 'Thank you Divyam, for giving your precious time for this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur. I hope your interview will help the students in their endeavours and we wish you all the best for your future achievements.', 'Thank you!'),
(291, 65, 'Interview process', 'Hello Sumit! I am Ankit Ranjan from communiqué. First of all, a big congratulations for making it into Fractal Analytics. Please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Thank you. There are three rounds of the interviews before which, they conduct a test to shortlist around 40 students. This year, 42 students were shortlisted based on it. There are a total of 62 questions in this test (2 hours test), four of which are coding problems and the rest are puzzles, math, or English questions. After you’ve been shortlisted, you’ll go through three rounds of interviews. The first two rounds can be interchanged. One round is related to business acumen to understand how much business understanding you have and the second is a tech-related interview. To the best of my understanding, there are two different types of interview processes. One is if you are into tech, and the other is if you don’t have much experience in tech. If you are not a techie, they will ask you some guesstimates or puzzles and will not get too much into tech; however, if you have a tech on your resume, they will focus more on the tech part, as was the case for me. In the first round, I was questioned about one of my internships at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange by a data analyst lead for one of the fractal’s teams. He was eager to understand how I learnt the financial concepts I needed during the project and how the tech implementation was done. They took around 15–20 minutes to discuss the CME project, and after that, they asked questions about my basic understanding of python. Then, I had a second round, after a break of 5–10 minutes. The second round was more of a tech. In this round, they didn’t ask standard DSA Questions, instead, they focused on deeper questions on machine learning at least this was the case for me. As Fractal has a lot of roles, they ask a variety of questions. For me, they took examples of ensemble learning algorithms and asked me about their working. So I had to give them a brief explanation of the algorithm, and the Mathematics behind it. Post this they quizzed me on a different project from my CV, which was my university of Iowa internship and then they asked me about what kind of data structures I had worked on, how did I implement that algorithm and what were things I was thinking of while implementing them. They were more interested to test my understanding of the math involved rather than the implementation of the algorithm. So, this was my second round of the interview. And my entire third round was devoted to discussing my reason for pursuing analytics after earning an undergraduate degree in Geology, as well as what I had done to prepare myself for the analytics sector.'),
(292, 65, 'Importance of project', 'Since you mentioned your project at the University of Iowa, I just wanted to know how significant is it to have a project from a reputed foreign university?', 'No, I don’t think that it is very important. As I told that Fractal’s interview process is more focused on the resume, right, and it depends on the interviewer as well. So in the first round, my CME group internship was more interesting for them. In the second round, it was my university of Iowa Project. So, it’s not specifically about the research internship that I am talking about but it’s more about the work that the interviewer is doing and how it is related to the work that I have done. And of course, adding a research internship and research project to your CV shows that you are more deeply into working on research-based projects, so they are expecting more of this from you. And since my project also focused on my ML work and which is why they asked a lot of questions on it.'),
(293, 65, 'FAQs for HR round', 'Though you have already mentioned the types of questions they ask, I want to ask in particular if there are puzzles or more HR questions in the different rounds of the interview?', 'As I mentioned, my first round contained business understanding questions. Since my intern at CME required a lot of business understanding, my interviewer didn’t go into the puzzle and guestimate side of the interview process but one can easily expect guesstimates in the Fractal interview.'),
(294, 65, 'Advice for interviews', 'How did you prepare for the interview? Any valuable advice that you would like to share?', 'As previously stated, it’s more of a CV based interview, so you don’t have to prepare any different sorts of skills. They don’t expect you to know SQL or DSA, if you have several machine learning internships as well as PORs (as in my case), then you are good to go with Fractal, you don’t have to prepare specific technical aspects. However, you should have a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms and be familiar with guesstimates and puzzles. So you should know some basic case prep and machine learning aspects (for tech) and you should do more puzzles, guesstimates and case prep (for non-tech).'),
(295, 65, 'Making a good CV', 'Since you mentioned the importance of CV in Fractal, can you suggest what should be mentioned in the CV to make it stand apart from the general public?', 'I’m not familiar with Fractal’s real shortlisting procedure. So, I’m not sure how they chose you. Most likely, my test score was the deciding factor in my selection. And for the things to be mentioned in my CV, like for the tech role, I had a corporate internship, a research internship and I do have several hackathons mentioned and apart from these tech-mentions, I do have several good PORs including that of a Hall President, Society Head and Governor. So, I would suggest trying to mention some PORs in your CV which is significant on the campus and apart from this try to put more tech into it. If you don’t have any tech experience, you can still get into Fractal by having a POR-focused CV and performing well in guesstimates. However, they do examine technical skills in your CV. So, try to include more tech in your CV, along with a few PORs that you believe are important on campus.'),
(296, 65, 'Resources for tech domain', 'Can you suggest some strategies or resources that can be helpful for preparation for the tech domain?', 'For the tech aspect, there are two different things that I know. One is on the DSA part — you should be doing basic DSA beforehand. This is a compulsion for every interview process, whether it is fractal or any other company. I would recommend that you take any DSA course. There are various resources for learning DSA, thus I won’t go into detail about them. So, one tip from my side is that you should be well-versed in DSA. There are numerous domains in machine learning, such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, etc. In machine learning, I had an internship in statistical learning. I didn’t go into Deep Learning or Natural Language Processing, but I did mention it in every interview. In a machine learning interview, they want to know how much you know about the algorithm and mathematics behind it. So, for that, the first and the basic course that needs to be done is the Andrew NG course. Apart from that, I would suggest stat quest lectures on youtube. Statquest lectures are very beneficial and will give a better understanding of machine learning and its practical application. That is what they expect from you. Just do two internships or projects on machine learning and learn the basic course on machine learning. Like I did Udemy A-Z, Andrew NG course and apart from that, Statquest lectures and several hands-on projects on Kaggle.'),
(297, 65, 'Advice for placement 2022', 'As a pre-final year student, what can students do to maximize their chances of successful placement, especially if they have not done any internship till now and not got PPO?', 'For those pre-final year students two-three things I would suggest. But these solutions will help you if you are sure of going into tech. Firstly, be very thorough with your DSA prep. So, start practising DSA, it’s an important step for any internship and placement. If you are done with DSA then I am pretty sure that you would be landing up in a good job and I believe that 3 to 4 months of DSA would help you in getting a good placement. But you have to be very dedicated to it. Apart from that since my interest was in machine learning among all domains in tech, what I did was just one or two internships in machine learning and had a basic understanding of what machine learning is. So this is how I prepared for my placements and I would also recommend that if you want to go into analytics, then these are the things that will help you in getting a good job.'),
(298, 65, 'Importance of competitive programming', 'One more thing students preparing for the analytics domain are often unsure how much they should emphasize on doing competitive programming. Any advice on that?', 'The point is for the test you need DSA. Four coding questions are being asked in Fractal for the shortlisting process. So DSA knowledge is a must to clear it. DSA is not just about competitive programming, but it is the problem-solving skill that you have. So if you don’t have anything in your CV, then the interviewer needs to know how good of a problem-solver you are, and this is how they prefer to check. From my perspective, you can’t be completely into machine learning without knowing DSA. I am not asking you to do competitive programming on code forces and all but if you have done basic 400–500 questions from InterviewBit or LeetCode, then it would suffice. So if you are looking for an analytics domain, you have to do coding to get placed at good companies. So for getting into good companies like Fractal, you need to have a good knowledge of DSA.'),
(299, 65, 'Message for Junta', 'Do you have any other suggestions for students preparing for placements this year?', 'I think there may be a lot of students facing the same problems during placement that I faced. I couldn’t decide which profile I should choose. So, I prepared for product management, analytics and coding as well. I was into various profiles. Hence I would suggest that you can follow any profile that you want but to secure your job then you should know how to code. If you want to take risks, you can directly work on product management or whatever you want to do. But if you want to get into a tech role, then coding is a must. Once coding is done then 80% of your work is done for placement. So according to me, coding is very important for getting into a good company if you are into tech or unsure about the profile to pursue.'),
(300, 65, 'Thank you!', 'Thank you so much Sumit for your time. It’ll surely be very helpful for all of the KGP junta preparing for analytics profile. Thanks a lot for giving this interview to Communiqué IIT Kharagpur and we wish you all the very best for all your future endeavours.', 'Thank you!'),
(301, 63, 'Introduction', 'Hello Diwakar! This is Sadhvika from Communiqué. Heartiest congratulations on being placed at Lam Research. If I have your consent may I take a short interview with you?', 'Thank you Sadhvika! Yeah sure, let’s have a discussion. Please go ahead.'),
(302, 63, 'Why Core..?', 'How did you decide to go in the core profile considering that coding and data are usually in vogue and are most talked about?', 'I had a liking for core mechanical engineering from the beginning itself, which did not change at any stage. I also knew about the various on-campus/ off-campus opportunities available in the domain. I had the interest and the confidence to excel as well, therefore, there was no reason I switched to other profiles.'),
(303, 63, 'Interview process', 'What was the general interview process (number of rounds, questions asked, topics they questioned about in each round, etc.) for the companies that you aimed for?', 'Most of the technical companies have similar interview processes. The first round is the technical round which generally takes about an hour. In this round, they cover up much of the whole mechanical course curriculum. The second round is the HR round but they did ask some Engineering intuitive questions in the interview of LAM Research and it took about 20–30 mins. Regarding written rounds: For Bajaj, we had the aptitude and core-based questions in MCQ format. The questions asked were theory-based, no numerical and relatively easier than others. The questions asked for the written round of placement for Lam were the most challenging and different according to me. The questions were subjective and were to be handwritten and uploaded in a portal that was provided. They had 8–9 questions to be solved in about 90 mins or so. The questions weren’t routine and they checked how strong your basics and application of concepts are. The second round is the interview round. Here I’d like to mention one thing that is even though my interview with Jaguar went very well, I wasn’t selected. The reason being that they had less vacancy and they preferred other candidates who had exposure in the domain of the automobile through some research group or research project they had been a part of. Bajaj also needs candidates with previous experience in that field. So my advice is that if you wish to join this field you should take an initiative to be a part of a research group or take a research project in this field.'),
(304, 63, 'Importance of cgpa', 'Many of us have heard that one should aim for going into the core sector only when your CG is high. Would you like to comment on that statement?', 'A good CGPA helps a lot. They are important for you to get selected for the interview round as the companies consider it along with the test scores. So above 8 is good enough, and above 8.5 would be a great place to be. Having said that the people with an average CG may also get shortlisted but make sure you have a good reason for it. Like you could back it up with a research project saying that you were more focused on gaining practical knowledge and such.'),
(305, 63, 'Resources', 'Any resources you’d like to mention which you used while preparing? Eg- any additionals you took, online courses, etc.', 'In my opinion, there is no need for additional courses because the college course curriculum covers everything you need. So if you are thorough with the curriculum then you will be able to crack the general placement process in the core. The additionals offered are very specific for a certain field and if you are preparing for a general core placement, then the course curriculum is your key. Taking additionals should solely be one’s own choice, based on the interest they have. Here I would also mention that many ignore their 1st and 2nd-year basic courses but they are the conceptual foundation, questions based on these are also asked in the interviews as well. So when you prepare for the placement I would advise you to revise all the concepts from your 1st year itself. It is not necessary to take up additional courses or any online material. Your course curriculum would be sufficient for the theory part. You should revise your concepts from a reference book because I believe that reading helps in better understanding and retaining the knowledge for a long time. And if you have taken up research or an internship you might need to learn software or two which you could from the many videos available on youtube and any other online platform.'),
(306, 63, 'Strategy of preparation', 'What was your strategy for preparation? Did you change it depending on which company you were aiming for and in between rounds?', 'First of all do not aim for just a single company and put all your energy behind it. You should aim for a set of 5 to 6 companies you wish to get into and focus on them and prepare accordingly so you don’t panic at the last moment. So my strategy was to prepare short notes of the topics as I revised them so that I could recollect all of them at the end. So in the last semester that is the placement semester I started preparing in this way and in 2–3 months I had covered up all the core engineering subjects and I had all the short notes ready with me. So whenever I had a test for a certain company it was very easy for me to revise the topics relevant to the profile of the company.'),
(307, 63, 'Opportunities to look for', 'It is generally said that there are fewer opportunities in the core sector than non-core sector. Is this the case and is if so what are the opportunities we should look out for and focus on?', 'There are many opportunities in the core sector though they may be less in the campus placements, there are many out of it. You can always get very good PSU jobs through GATE and you get into government sectors through engineering services examinations. Apart from that, there are examinations conducted for ISRO, DRDO, BARC, and so on. So opportunities are there. We just need to explore and have an open mind towards it.'),
(308, 63, 'Research project under a professor', 'How often do we get an opportunity to work on a research project under a professor on the campus?', 'It truly depends on the professor. Like some professors who are quite reputed for their research in the department, they like to take students early. They would have students under them from the second year itself. It would be difficult to get a project under them in the later years. So you could approach them in the second year itself when you are well acquainted with a few core topics and learn your interests. But yes, BTPs and MTPs are also a very good option since 2 years is also enough to get a good yield project in the core. BTPs and MTPs are not difficult to get under a professor of your choice, but it is always advisable to start early on. To get a good project, you should first check the profile of the professor and learn what his field of research is. This can be easily learned by the institutes’ webpage for the faculty department. And then you need to explore a bit on your own so that you are properly acquainted with it and make sure the research is relevant to the industry. So now when you approach a professor saying you are interested in his research and wish to work under him, seeing that you are well informed about the project, you have significant chances of securing the opportunity. You should also take initiative from the beginning itself to get the best out of the professor because several students are working under him. So he would focus on you only if you show interest in it. Some of the professors also consider your CGPA but not many. So if you show a real interest in the domain, CGPA shouldn’t be a problem.'),
(309, 63, 'Advice for juniors', 'What advice would you like to give your juniors who will be sitting for placements this year?', 'I would advise them to focus on the thing under their control. With the circumstances of today, a lot of things might feel uncertain and chaotic. So keeping your focus is very important. Like for example, I had expected to get into ISRO as it had been visiting our campus in the past few years but at the last moment, I was informed that it wouldn’t visit the campus this year. So in this situation, you should try to focus on the fact that you still haven’t lost the opportunity and you have a lot of time to prepare and things like that. Because your efforts and hard work will never be wasted and will always pay off well.'),
(310, 63, 'Internship in second year', 'What is your opinion on taking an internship in the second year?', 'Considering the time we all are facing I’m sure how possible it would be to get an internship in the core industry and that too for a second year. The reason being the restricted mobility now. But even if you don’t have an internship, you can always approach a professor. Working under a professor in the second year is very underrated when it is a great opportunity to get an insight into the core domain that not many of your peers would have. In my opinion, it is the best possible use of your time.'),
(311, 63, 'Message for Junta', 'What would you like to say to the general KGP public out there? Any advice for them?', 'I would like to say that you need to maintain a balance in your life. Academics are important but so is socializing and developing your personality and making friends for life while on campus. As you’re not only going to take a degree with you but also the memories of the years of your life spent here, to cherish for a lifetime. So be a better judge of yourself to know the right time to do what. When you will be able to judge yourself, that’s when you will enjoy your life here to the fullest and never regret what you did.'),
(312, 64, 'Interview process', 'Today we have Pankaj Mishra with us who has been placed at Mckinsey. So first heartiest Congratulations on that. Pankaj please tell us about the general interview process for the companies you interviewed? Please mention the number of rounds and the nature of the interview process.', 'Thanks a lot. For Mckinsey, the shortlisting process was different from the general CDC process because you don’t apply through CDC. Instead, you get an email from Mckinsey asking you to apply directly on their website. So all you need to do is submit your CV and fill out the questionnaire on the website. Once you’ve applied, in a week or so you’ll get an email revealing whether you’ve been shortlisted for the interviews or not. This time some 20 folks were shortlisted. The shortlisted candidates are allotted two buddies from the company. These buddies are employees working for Mckinsey. In my case, one of them was an analyst and the other was an associate. After you’ve been shortlisted, there are around 14 days before your interviews start. During this period, you are supposed to talk to your buddies, try and understand how Mckinsey works and whether you will be a right fit for the company or not. You can talk to your buddies about pretty much anything that you want to know or are curious about because it’s non-evaluative. This includes things like the career growth for an analyst, the exit opportunities and the compensation. You should also try and understand the company culture and what is expected from an analyst. That‘s what most of my buddy conversations revolved around. Sometimes in this phase, you also have to go through a digital assessment, which is a proprietary gamified assessment Mckinsey has developed that judges your problem-solving skills. The assessment is a necessary part of the process, but as far as I understood, the assessment score would only play a role if you are on the edge. So long as you clear the interviews by a sufficient margin, the scores shouldn’t matter. The evaluation process begins with 2 interviews for each candidate. These are taken either by associates or engagement managers which is one level above the associates. If someone makes it past the 2 interviews, they proceed to the partner round. So to get an offer from the firm, you need to clear a total of 4 interviews.'),
(313, 64, 'Questions asked', 'Could you please list down the questions you were asked in the different rounds? Cases, HR Discussions, or puzzles in general that you think will prove to be helpful for students.', 'The first two interviews were fairly standard case interviews. However, compared to the typical case interviews (from what I found on YouTube), at McKinsey, they were a lot more conversational, not just in terms of asking for clarification on data or questions but the whole process, in general, felt a lot more like a discussion than an interview. Throughout the interview, it felt like they put a lot more emphasis on establishing a rapport with you and tackling the problem as a team, which was in contrast to the interviews for software roles where the interview is almost single-handedly driven by the candidate with very little input from the interviewer after sharing the initial question. My first interview was about an IT giant that was trying to digitize the infrastructure of a client which was a healthcare company working across the country. This meant transforming all the company data to digital format for easier access and analysis. The main objective was to determine the right processes to make this transformation as secure as possible from malicious actors that might attempt to steal or gain unauthorized access to the data lakes. The interviewer asked me to list down all the possible things that could go wrong in such a scenario, elaborate on each one of them and that was it. This was followed by a puzzle about calculating the number of matches that need to be conducted in a knock-out tournament until you find a winner. That was it for my first interview. I was told that it would last 40–45min, but mine got over in about 30 mins. The second interview was quite similar. It was about a baby food company trying to expand its presence in the country, gain market share and increase its revenue in the process. Again the interviewer wasn’t focused on or expected a specific answer that he already had in mind. Instead, he picked up the recommendations I gave and drilled further into each of them. He wasn’t trying to push me in any particular direction and was quite excited to see all the different directions I took to tackle the problem at hand. With that, the second interview was also over. Within a few hours of the second interview, I received an email informing me that I’d been shortlisted for the second round of interviews with the partners. The partner round was undeniably a lot more relaxed and chilled out. In both the interviews I felt absolutely no pressure as the interviewers did a great job at making you feel comfortable in their presence. The problems in this round were even more open-ended and I would be hard-pressed to even call them a real case interview. My first interviewer in this round was a partner with expertise in IT services and digitization. So naturally, he asked me a question about an IT services giant that was trying to expand its business in the country. The goal was not to come up with a very low-level, technical solution. The interviewer was more interested in the breadth rather than the depth of my solution. So recommendations like providing after-market customer care, providing deployment solutions were better received than purely technical recommendations such as adopting new frameworks and technologies. This was followed by an easy numerical problem on calculating the time required to hit some predetermined revenue target given the individual revenue each client brings in. A few hours later on the same day, I had my second interview. It was taken by Aditya Sharma who I believe takes most of the final interviews for KGP. This interview was extremely informal and very pleasant. It started with brief introductions from both of us and why I wanted to work for Mckinsey. He asked a couple of questions on why consulting as well as a few other fairly standard HR questions like “the most challenging thing you’ve done in life”. So even though the questions were quite generic, the focus was not just on the content of your answers but also on you as an individual. From what I was told later, the objective of these interviews is also to gauge the type of person you are, and whether you’d be a good fit for the team. The work hours for consultants are extremely brutal and they put a lot of emphasis on bringing in only those people who they feel would mesh well with the team. Once this part of the interview was over, we started with a case that again wasn’t structured in any specific manner. It was about the Indian Government attempting to boost tourism and reach and eventually surpass, pre-pandemic levels as soon as possible. In short, what would you do to attract more tourists from all over the world? Here the conversation quickly took a candid turn and we started discussing what our country could do to improve its image on a global level and attract people from different parts of the world. He analysed the depth of my argument for each recommendation I pitched with a lot of cross-questioning. Finally, the most exciting part of the interview was a guesstimate to find the number of credit card users in India. It was the most fun part of the entire process because it had the right balance of logic and intuition. That was the end of the fourth interview and the entire interview process for McKinsey.'),
(314, 64, 'FAQs for HR round', 'What are some of the FAQs in most companies that you faced and think students must prepare for? More specifically, in the context of HR rounds.', 'One common question they asked in three interviews out of the four was to introduce myself. I’d say consulting isn’t so much about problem-solving as it is about being able to express your ideas clearly and in a lucid manner. Of course, they do require you to be adept at problem-solving too, but I’d say most KGPians would already be good enough to clear their bar without any extra preparation. However, when they ask you to introduce yourself, they are not expecting you to introduce yourself as you would in KGP’s orientation programs. They genuinely want to know you as a person. So tell them something that’s not immediately obvious or written on your resume, share your interests and what makes you. What they are looking for is someone they would want to have on their team. In my case, I didn’t talk about my resume at all as they’d have already gone through that before the interview. I told them about my interests in biology and cultural history; something that they wouldn’t expect from a typical engineering candidate. One of my interviewers was also really interested in biology and computer science, and these shared interests quickly helped me establish a rapport with them. So be authentic and tell them about your real motivations and interests. They also want to know if you are genuinely excited about joining McKinsey or is it just another company you are appearing for as part of the placements. So it’s a good idea to spend some time and list down what aspects of consulting genuinely excite you. There’s no reason to pretend as the interviewers are experts at identifying bullshit answers. As long as you are being genuine, the HR questions are relatively straightforward to tackle. Sometimes people think that their ‘genuine’ answers aren’t good enough for the interview, but that’s not true. Even if the motive is just to get a well-paying job, you can always look around on the internet and see what the job entails. Being genuine does not mean you have to be an ardent enthusiast or extremely passionate about consulting as a career. You can always identify what parts of the job excite and resonate with you *after* applying for the job.'),
(315, 64, 'Advice for placements 2022', 'What are things students sitting for placements next year can do from now until December to maximize their chances of getting through a company in consulting?', 'I am not sure if this is going to be a good answer because from what I have heard, McKinsey is the only consulting company that has this casual-ish case interview structure where the focus is on evaluating your personality as much as the answers you come up with. Most of the other companies usually tend to focus on the case itself and don’t concern themselves much with other things. If we talk only about McKinsey, then one of the biggest things one can do to clear these interviews would be to improve your communication skills. I’d say that is the most important skill they are looking for, maybe even more than your problem-solving skills. Many people I’ve interacted with share this sentiment, with numerous instances where folks who were never really targeting consulting roles crack these interviews not because they’d been practising cases for a long time, but because they polished their communication skills over the years. Being able to structure your thoughts and make it easy for others to comprehend them is a seriously underrated skill. So practice communication more than anything else, that’d be my one piece of advice.'),
(316, 64, 'Preparation after shortlisting', 'How did your preparation for Case rounds evolve once you were shortlisted, please let us know about the resources you used as well?', 'I hadn’t prepared for case interviews per se because consulting was never my primary goal. But after I was shortlisted, I had 2 mock case interviews with my buddies, and I felt that was sufficient. I’d say as long as you’ve done a couple of cases, you should be good to go because it’s not the problem-solving skills that we’re lacking, but the ability to structure and lay down our thoughts and ideas in a proper manner. I struggled a lot in my very first mock interview because even though the problem itself wasn’t very challenging, I didn’t know how to sequence my suggestions and tailor them so that they’d follow the next seamlessly. What we need to work on is how to think about ideas and structure them so that they are not all over the place, and a few mock cases are more than enough to help with that. Coming to the resources, I used this book called Case in Point: Complete Case Interview Preparation Book by Marc Cosentino which was a recommendation from my buddy. I feel all the things I talked about just now like structuring your thoughts and improving the clarity are beautifully explained there.');

(317, 64, 'Message for the Junta', 'Anything else that you’d want to share with the students?', 'Somehow people have this notion that consulting is this top-tier job that is elusive to most folks. But I don’t think that is the case. Like I said earlier, consulting is all about being able to express your thoughts in a structured form which makes it easy to understand for the masses. So if you want to grab a consulting job, it would be better to focus on these skills that matter during the interview. Coming to the shortlisting process, I am not an authority on what sort of a resume will be shortlisted and what others would be rejected. But I do feel that the general pattern that these firms follow is shortlisting candidates that have demonstrated excellence in any one particular aspect of their life. I had zero PORs, and neither was I part of any societies or clubs. But I still managed to get shortlisted and I think that is because my resume was loaded with technical experience and achievements. Multiple internship experiences, along with open-source contributions through programs like GSoC helped my resume stand out from the crowd. On the other hand, there were just as many, if not more shortlisted candidates who didn’t have any technical experience but had a lot of leadership experience through societies, clubs and PORs. So as long as you’re doing exceptionally well in any one particular field, you should be good to go. This should also come as a respite for people who didn’t really join any societies early on but still want to get into consulting: PORs are not the end of the line. Another thing I’d want to stress on is the difference between good communication skills and fluency, something I see being conflated a lot on campus. People assume that having good communication skills is the same as being an expert in English, but that’s not true. While being fluent in English can be an advantage, it’s not a prerequisite for developing decent communication skills. The idea of communication is to be able to express your thoughts and ideas in a manner such that they are easily understood by the other person, that’s it. Even if you take small gaps or take some time to come up with your words, it’s perfectly okay. Just because someone speaks a lot faster than another person, does not always mean they’re conveying a proportionately greater amount of information through their words. That’s all from my side. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn or through the mail for any more questions. I’d be happy to help. All the best for placements!'),
